# wiki_rest_api

This is a REST API Wikipedia-style service. It connects with MongoDB via Mongoose. Was tested with Postman. 

Get, Post, Put, Patch, Delete operations translated into CRUD operations for MongoDB. 

Cool feature - chained route handlers with Express. 

Tech stack: Node.js, Express.js, NPM, MongoDB, Mongoose, Postman, EJS
